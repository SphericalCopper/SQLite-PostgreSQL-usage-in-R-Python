# Overview
This repository hosts projects where PostgreSQL and SQLite were using in conjunction with R/Python (run in a Jupyter Notebook environment), to either query, modify, or create a database.


## 1) Anwering Business Questions using SQL
SQLite and R were used to query a database (`chinook.db`), to answer a variety of business questions for a music company to help them make better business decisions, pertaining to:

- Determining Genre Popularity
- Employee Performance
- Customer-base Demographics and Sales Revenue by Country
- Customer Purchase Behavior

Visualizations depicting these findings were created through the ggplot2 library of R.

## 2) Analyzing CIA Factbook.

The `factbook.db` database built off information from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/) was queried to convert the information within the database into a form that makes it easier for us to learn about each country.

## 3) Building a Sports Database.
